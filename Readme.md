## Cyclistic Case Study
Cyclistic is a company of bike sharing in Chicago. Their strategy is based on the flexibility of pricing plans they offer as well as the diversity of bikes, customers can choose the plan and bike that suits them.
* Cyclistic has 5824 bikes and 692 stations.
* The pricing plan for those riders are three: single ride pass, full day pass, annual pass.
* It has two types of riders: Casual riders (those with single ride pass or full day pass), members (those with a year membership).
The company finance analysts found that annual members are more profitable than casuals, and the challenge is to determine whether converting casual riders to members by using social media can increase its profit. That’s why, me as an analyst will use data to help my team to support or reject that decision.
I used the 6 steps recommended by the Google Data Analytics course: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act during the entire work process. I used R for data exploration, cleaning and analysis as well as Tableau in this project.
